<h1>Prathamesh Joshi</h1>
<p class="muted">Principal Software Engineer · IoT · Distributed Systems · Cloud</p>

<p>
I build real-world systems that run at scale — from embedded devices and edge connectivity
to high-throughput backend services, cloud infrastructure, and data platforms.
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I’m a Co-founder & Principal Engineer at Carnot Technologies (now part of Mahindra Group),
where I design and build large-scale IoT and telematics platforms.
</p>

<p>
Over the last decade, I’ve worked across the stack: embedded systems, device connectivity,
backend services, cloud infrastructure, and analytics. Systems I’ve built operate at meaningful
scale, handling hundreds of millions of telemetry events per day across large device fleets.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy working on problems that sit at the intersection of hardware and software, especially
systems that must handle real-world constraints like unreliable networks, partial failures,
and operational complexity. I also enjoy applying data and AI-driven approaches on top of
large-scale systems to extract actionable insights.
</p>

<h2>What I work on</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Distributed backend systems and real-time data pipelines</li>
  <li>IoT platforms, device gateways, and telemetry ingestion</li>
  <li>Cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure (IaC, Kubernetes)</li>
  <li>Embedded systems and hardware–software integration</li>
  <li>Reliability, security, and cost optimization at scale</li>
  <li>Data platforms, analytics, and AI-enabled products</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selected work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Architected hardware-agnostic IoT cloud platforms for large device fleets</li>
  <li>Built high-throughput systems processing hundreds of millions of events per day</li>
  <li>Led multi-cloud infrastructure and reduced per-device operating costs significantly</li>
  <li>Designed secure device onboarding and OTA/FOTA pipelines</li>
  <li>Worked closely with OEMs and cross-functional engineering teams</li>
</ul>
